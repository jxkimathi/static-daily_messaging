You don't mince your words when you speak about your values or faith. You're firm but also carry alot of grace with you. You're all the things they say love to be; kind, patient, selfless and many more. I'm grateful to be part of that love you carry so dearly. Here's to day 3 of 22ðŸ’—", order: 2 },

You always hold my hand through the days that feel so bleak. I donâ€™t doubt alot when youâ€™re with me because you always remind me that I can do anything I put my mind to.

But whenever Iâ€™ve mentioned something that I donâ€™t like or makes me feel some type of way you always make it right. Granted most times I donâ€™t even see the unreasonableness in my claims but you never complain about it. You go out of your way to make me happy even if itâ€™s the littlest thing. You pay so much attention to details that I usually miss. You always say that you know me better than myself.(I still heavily doubt that) but youâ€™re well on your way there. You give me so much grace and patience that I donâ€™t give myself a lot. You make me realize that things donâ€™t have to be perfect for them to work. You keep me grounded because Lord knows I love to fly sometimes. Youâ€™re the voice in my head that says everything will be okay even when I donâ€™t believe it. I adore how youâ€™re able to be a voice of reason every time and still have compassion as well. Dealing with me isnâ€™t easy but somehow you always make me feel like Iâ€™m not doing much even when I feel like Iâ€™ve over the top. I love you! Hereâ€™s toÂ dayÂ 6Â ofÂ 22ðŸ’—", order: 5 },

Your light hearted banter keeps me going. I donâ€™t take the little  moments that we have together for granted. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve stopped smiling since we met. Even if we have our downs the ups are worth more. You remind me that thereâ€™s always joy around me because you donâ€™t stop calling me that anyway and I donâ€™t want you to honestly. Youâ€™ve become the best part of my days and nights. What I look foward to after a long day. I donâ€™t think itâ€™s possible to have bad days when you exist in my life. I pray that I make your days brighter and lighter and that you always feel happy by my side. Well I know you do cause you always show youâ€™re 32 teeth around meðŸ˜­.

You give so much grace to the people around you and I know because I feel it everyday. You make want to become a better person and sometimes just have a little bit of the grace you have. I hope that you remember to give yourself the same grace that you show others, to go east on yourself sometimes and to rest whenever you need to. Even if you forget Iâ€™ll always be here to remind you to breathe and relax.

Youâ€™ve show me through how you live your life that thereâ€™s always something to look forward to and something to fight for. You listen to me when I complain about something thatâ€™s not going right and know just the words to say to make me fight for what I want. Everyday with you makes me have a clear vision of my life. A life that I want to have with you and one that I want to build. You make me feel celebrated of my achievements even when I donâ€™t feel like theyâ€™re much. You push me to be a better version of myself everyday. I love you because I already see the traits of who I want to be in you and I see that our goals always align. I wouldnâ€™t want anyone else cheering me on if it wasnâ€™t you. In return Iâ€™ll always be here to cheer you on and tell you how proud of you I am everyday. In these 4 months that weâ€™ve been getting to know each other Iâ€™ve not only seen you grow everyday but also seen you push yourself to limits I didnâ€™t even know was possible.

The moments when you look at me with the kindest eyes and even without saying anything and I can feel so much love held within that gaze. Iâ€™ve always wanted a soft love where I feel safe and youâ€™ve given me that. Iâ€™m grateful everyday to get to experience the gentle person that you are and pure love that you have to give.

You supplement my bad days with good ones, my sad times with happy ones and my lonely ones with love and comfort. Thereâ€™s not a person in this world I would rather spend time with other than you. Missing you is both a blessing and a curse cause I would spend every waking second with you but longing for you is a unique experience. I love you!! HappyÂ dayÂ 11Â ofÂ 22ðŸ’—", order: 10 },

As someone whoâ€™s used to taking on the world alone you remind me that I donâ€™t have to do that. You keep me aligned and make me know that Iâ€™m cared for. Slowly youâ€™ve helped me bring down my walls and when I constantly try to rebuild them you take down real quick. You give me strength to go on everyday and Iâ€™m forever grateful for that. Sometimes I may not see what you see in me but Iâ€™m glad to have someone who looks at me with so much compassion and love. A great part of why this year has been great for me is because Iâ€™ve done it with you by my side. Most if not all of the accomplishments Iâ€™ve had this year are cause youâ€™ve held me down in more ways than I could ever imagine and held me accountable with so much love. Youâ€™re my rock!

You truly make my life have more meaning and you give me something special to look forward to everyday. I hope to always keep that fire burning inside you and that spark that you have alive. I enjoy every moment that I share with you. Idk how different life would have been without you this year but Iâ€™m glad that I donâ€™t need to know that.
