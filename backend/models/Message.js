You are one of the brightest minds I know and you bring so much joy and light into the world. I want you to know that you are seen and loved.

You always push me to do the things that I love and to never give up even when I'm so done with it. You are such a rock and I hope that fire in you never dies. I'm so proud of the person you are and the person you continue to be everyday. Here's to day 2 of 22ðŸ’—", order: 1 },
      { _id: "3", text: "It's very rare to find someone who wears his heart on his sleeve like you do. You never keep me guessing on where we are or how you feel and you're always honest about that. You don't mince your words when you speak about your values or faith. You're firm but also carry alot of grace with you. You're all the things they say love to be; kind, patient, selfless and many more. I'm grateful to be part of that love you carry so dearly. Here's to day 3 of 22ðŸ’—", order: 2 },

You carry that with you so proudly and so firmly. I love that you try to share pieces of that with me and you slowly bring me into your world. Itâ€™s one of the things that I never expected from you but itâ€™s also one of the things that draw me closer to you everyday. Hereâ€™s toÂ dayÂ 4Â ofÂ 22ðŸ’—", order: 3 },

But from you itâ€™s like a warm hug, what keeps me moving through the days. You remind me that Iâ€™m not too much and that youâ€™re always here. You always hold my hand through the days that feel so bleak. I donâ€™t doubt alot when youâ€™re with me because you always remind me that I can do anything I put my mind to. That I shouldnâ€™t give up and that youâ€™ll always be next to me. Youâ€™re my light and I can only hope to be the same for you. Hereâ€™s toÂ dayÂ 5Â ofÂ 22ðŸ’—", order: 4 },

But whenever Iâ€™ve mentioned something that I donâ€™t like or makes me feel some type of way you always make it right. Granted most times I donâ€™t even see the unreasonableness in my claims but you never complain about it. You go out of your way to make me happy even if itâ€™s the littlest thing. You pay so much attention to details that I usually miss. You always say that you know me better than myself.(I still heavily doubt that) but youâ€™re well on your way there. You give me so much grace and patience that I donâ€™t give myself a lot. You make me realize that things donâ€™t have to be perfect for them to work. You keep me grounded because Lord knows I love to fly sometimes. Youâ€™re the voice in my head that says everything will be okay even when I donâ€™t believe it. I adore how youâ€™re able to be a voice of reason every time and still have compassion as well. Dealing with me isnâ€™t easy but somehow you always make me feel like Iâ€™m not doing much even when I feel like Iâ€™ve over the top. I love you! Hereâ€™s toÂ dayÂ 6Â ofÂ 22ðŸ’—", order: 5 },

Your light hearted banter keeps me going. I donâ€™t take the little  moments that we have together for granted. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve stopped smiling since we met. Even if we have our downs the ups are worth more. You remind me that thereâ€™s always joy around me because you donâ€™t stop calling me that anyway and I donâ€™t want you to honestly. Youâ€™ve become the best part of my days and nights. What I look foward to after a long day. I donâ€™t think itâ€™s possible to have bad days when you exist in my life. I pray that I make your days brighter and lighter and that you always feel happy by my side. Well I know you do cause you always show youâ€™re 32 teeth around meðŸ˜­. All in all youâ€™re my happiness and I love that I get to experience the joy you carry around everyday. Hereâ€™s toÂ dayÂ 7Â ofÂ 22ðŸ’—", order: 6 }
