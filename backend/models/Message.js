Granted most times I donâ€™t even see the unreasonableness in my claims but you never complain about it. You go out of your way to make me happy even if itâ€™s the littlest thing. You pay so much attention to details that I usually miss. You always say that you know me better than myself.(I still heavily doubt that) but youâ€™re well on your way there. You give me so much grace and patience that I donâ€™t give myself a lot. You make me realize that things donâ€™t have to be perfect for them to work. You keep me grounded because Lord knows I love to fly sometimes. Youâ€™re the voice in my head that says everything will be okay even when I donâ€™t believe it. I adore how youâ€™re able to be a voice of reason every time and still have compassion as well. Dealing with me isnâ€™t easy but somehow you always make me feel like Iâ€™m not doing much even when I feel like Iâ€™ve over the top. I love you! Hereâ€™s toÂ dayÂ 6Â ofÂ 22ðŸ’—", order: 5 },

Your light hearted banter keeps me going. I donâ€™t take the little  moments that we have together for granted. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve stopped smiling since we met. Even if we have our downs the ups are worth more. You remind me that thereâ€™s always joy around me because you donâ€™t stop calling me that anyway and I donâ€™t want you to honestly. Youâ€™ve become the best part of my days and nights. What I look foward to after a long day. I donâ€™t think itâ€™s possible to have bad days when you exist in my life.

You give so much grace to the people around you and I know because I feel it everyday. You make want to become a better person and sometimes just have a little bit of the grace you have. I hope that you remember to give yourself the same grace that you show others, to go east on yourself sometimes and to rest whenever you need to.

Youâ€™ve show me through how you live your life that thereâ€™s always something to look forward to and something to fight for. You listen to me when I complain about something thatâ€™s not going right and know just the words to say to make me fight for what I want. Everyday with you makes me have a clear vision of my life. A life that I want to have with you and one that I want to build. You make me feel celebrated of my achievements even when I donâ€™t feel like theyâ€™re much. You push me to be a better version of myself everyday. I love you because I already see the traits of who I want to be in you and I see that our goals always align. I wouldnâ€™t want anyone else cheering me on if it wasnâ€™t you. In return Iâ€™ll always be here to cheer you on and tell you how proud of you I am everyday.

The moments when you look at me with the kindest eyes and even without saying anything and I can feel so much love held within that gaze. Iâ€™ve always wanted a soft love where I feel safe and youâ€™ve given me that. Iâ€™m grateful everyday to get to experience the gentle person that you are and pure love that you have to give.

Slowly youâ€™ve helped me bring down my walls and when I constantly try to rebuild them you take down real quick. You give me strength to go on everyday and Iâ€™m forever grateful for that. Sometimes I may not see what you see in me but Iâ€™m glad to have someone who looks at me with so much compassion and love. A great part of why this year has been great for me is because Iâ€™ve done it with you by my side.

You make me learn about my feelings more and recognize different patterns in my life. You make me want to learn more about your world just to see how I can fit. You make calm which is usually rare since my mind is always racing. You make me learn how to love beyond what I knew love was. You taught me thatâ€™s itâ€™s more than a feeling but a choice. You make the world a kinder place for everyone who gets to experience life with you. Learning more about you, myself and us has been an interesting experience but one I wouldnâ€™t change.
